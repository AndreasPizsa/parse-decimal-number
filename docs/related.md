To keep this project as small and modular as possible, the locale data itself has been left out of this library. If you need locale date, other projects might be helpful:

* [Numeral](http://numeraljs.com)
* [jsi18n](https://github.com/marcoscaceres/jsi18n)
* [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/latest)
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Examples_of_use)
